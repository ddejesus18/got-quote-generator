This project is a random quote generator based on the show "Game of Thrones". 

The code is comprised of HTML, CSS and raw JavaScript. 

When the button is pressed, a quote will randomly be selected from our array containing quotes. 

This is my first JavaScript project and I will be using the following concepts: 

* Math.floor(Math.random())
* for loop 
* array
